You are an expert reviewer tasked with evaluating a scientific summary based on the following criteria:
1. **Accuracy**: Does the summary correctly reflect the key points and findings of the articles?
2. **Completeness**: Does the summary include all major findings without omitting essential information?
3. **Clarity**: Is the summary clear, well-structured, and easy to understand?
4. **Conciseness**: Is the summary concise, avoiding unnecessary verbosity while retaining essential details?
5. **Relevance**: Is all included information pertinent to the main topic without introducing unrelated content?
6. **Objectivity**: Is the summary unbiased, presenting information factually without personal opinions or interpretations?

**Original Abstracts:**
A novel series of steroidal β-carboline quaternary ammonium derivatives (SCQADs) derived from natural cholic acid and its derivatives was designed, synthesized and biologically evaluated against four Gram-positive bacteria for the first time. Most of these derivatives exhibited promising antibacterial activity against the tested strains, particularly, compound 21g displayed strong antibacterial activity against MRSA (MIC = 0.5-1 μg/mL) with low cytotoxicity. Meanwhile, derivative 21g was able to quickly kill Gram-positive bacteria within 0.5 h without inducing bacterial resistance. Preliminary mechanistic explorations indicated that compound 21g destroyed bacterial cell membranes to exert its antibacterial effects. Moreover, 21g exhibited high in vivo efficacy and high survival protection in a mouse skin abscess model. These findings suggested that compound 21g has great potential to develop as an antibacterial agent.

As the harm of benzalkyl dimethylammonium compounds (BACs) on human health and environment was discovered, alkyltrimethyl ammonium compound (ATMAC) and dialkyldimethyl ammonium compound (DADMAC), which belong to quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs), were likely to replace BACs as the main disinfectants. This study simulated the iterative use of QACs to explore their impact on resistance genes (RGs) in nitrification systems pre-contaminated by BACs. ATMAC could initiate and maintain partial nitrification. DADMAC generated higher levels of reactive oxygen species and lactate dehydrogenase, leading to increased biological toxicity in bacteria. The abundance of intracellular RGs of sludge was higher with the stress of QACs. DADMAC also induced higher extracellular polymeric substance secretion. Moreover, it facilitated the transfer of RGs from sludge to water, with ATMAC disseminating RGs through si-tnpA-04 and DADMAC through si-intI1. Sediminibacterium might be potential hosts for RGs. This study offered insights into disinfectant usage in the post-COVID-19 era.

**Generated Summary:**
Article 1 focuses on the effectiveness of quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) in combating MRSA. The study found that QACs were highly effective in killing MRSA bacteria, even at low concentrations. The researchers used a variety of QACs and tested their efficacy through in vitro experiments. The results showed that QACs disrupted the cell membranes of MRSA, leading to bacterial death. This research suggests that QACs could be a promising solution for controlling MRSA infections.

Article 2 delves into the mechanisms by which QACs combat MRSA. The study discovered that QACs work by disrupting the cell membranes of MRSA bacteria, leading to their death. The researchers used advanced imaging techniques to observe the interaction between QACs and MRSA at the molecular level. The findings shed light on the specific ways in which QACs target and eliminate MRSA, providing valuable insights for developing new antimicrobial strategies. This research highlights the potential of QACs as a powerful tool in the fight against MRSA infections.

In summary, both articles underscore the effectiveness of quaternary ammonium compounds in combating MRSA. The studies demonstrate that QACs can effectively kill MRSA bacteria by disrupting their cell membranes. By using in vitro experiments and advanced imaging techniques, researchers were able to uncover the mechanisms through which QACs target and eliminate MRSA. These findings have important implications for developing new antimicrobial strategies to control MRSA infections. Overall, the research suggests that QACs could be a valuable asset in the fight against antibiotic-resistant bacteria like MRSA.

For each criterion, provide a score out of 10 and a brief comment. Remember the summary is supposed to be a 400-word high-level summary and will purposefully only discuss key findings while omitting specific details.Format the output as a JSON object with each criterion as a key, containing the score and comment. Additionally, provide an overall score out of 60.
