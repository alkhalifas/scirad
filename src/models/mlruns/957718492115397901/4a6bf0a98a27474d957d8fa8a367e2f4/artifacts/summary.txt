Research on quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) has shown their effectiveness in combating MRSA, a drug-resistant bacterium. Studies have demonstrated that QACs disrupt the cell membranes of MRSA, leading to cell death. Various methodologies, including in vitro and in vivo experiments, have been utilized to investigate the antimicrobial properties of QACs against MRSA. The findings suggest that QACs could be a promising solution for controlling MRSA infections in healthcare settings. These compounds have the potential to be used in disinfectants and surface coatings to reduce the spread of MRSA and other drug-resistant bacteria. Overall, research on QACs highlights their significance in addressing the growing concern of antibiotic resistance and the need for alternative antimicrobial agents.
