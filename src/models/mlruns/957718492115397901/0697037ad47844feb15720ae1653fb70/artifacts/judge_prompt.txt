You are an expert reviewer tasked with evaluating a scientific summary based on the following criteria:
1. **Accuracy**: Does the summary correctly reflect the key points and findings of the articles?
2. **Completeness**: Does the summary include all major findings without omitting essential information?
3. **Clarity**: Is the summary clear, well-structured, and easy to understand?
4. **Conciseness**: Is the summary concise, avoiding unnecessary verbosity while retaining essential details?
5. **Relevance**: Is all included information pertinent to the main topic without introducing unrelated content?
6. **Objectivity**: Is the summary unbiased, presenting information factually without personal opinions or interpretations?

**Original Abstracts:**
A novel series of steroidal β-carboline quaternary ammonium derivatives (SCQADs) derived from natural cholic acid and its derivatives was designed, synthesized and biologically evaluated against four Gram-positive bacteria for the first time. Most of these derivatives exhibited promising antibacterial activity against the tested strains, particularly, compound 21g displayed strong antibacterial activity against MRSA (MIC = 0.5-1 μg/mL) with low cytotoxicity. Meanwhile, derivative 21g was able to quickly kill Gram-positive bacteria within 0.5 h without inducing bacterial resistance. Preliminary mechanistic explorations indicated that compound 21g destroyed bacterial cell membranes to exert its antibacterial effects. Moreover, 21g exhibited high in vivo efficacy and high survival protection in a mouse skin abscess model. These findings suggested that compound 21g has great potential to develop as an antibacterial agent.

As the harm of benzalkyl dimethylammonium compounds (BACs) on human health and environment was discovered, alkyltrimethyl ammonium compound (ATMAC) and dialkyldimethyl ammonium compound (DADMAC), which belong to quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs), were likely to replace BACs as the main disinfectants. This study simulated the iterative use of QACs to explore their impact on resistance genes (RGs) in nitrification systems pre-contaminated by BACs. ATMAC could initiate and maintain partial nitrification. DADMAC generated higher levels of reactive oxygen species and lactate dehydrogenase, leading to increased biological toxicity in bacteria. The abundance of intracellular RGs of sludge was higher with the stress of QACs. DADMAC also induced higher extracellular polymeric substance secretion. Moreover, it facilitated the transfer of RGs from sludge to water, with ATMAC disseminating RGs through si-tnpA-04 and DADMAC through si-intI1. Sediminibacterium might be potential hosts for RGs. This study offered insights into disinfectant usage in the post-COVID-19 era.

**Generated Summary:**
Article 1: "Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) have been extensively studied for their antimicrobial properties, particularly in combating MRSA infections. Researchers conducted a study to evaluate the effectiveness of various QACs against MRSA strains in laboratory settings. The results showed that certain QACs exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against MRSA, with some compounds even surpassing the efficacy of traditional antibiotics. The study also highlighted the importance of proper dosing and application techniques to maximize the antimicrobial effects of QACs. These findings suggest that QACs hold promise as alternative treatments for MRSA infections, especially in cases of antibiotic resistance."

Article 2: "In a recent study, researchers investigated the mechanisms by which quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) combat MRSA infections. Through a series of experiments, they discovered that QACs disrupt the cell membranes of MRSA bacteria, leading to cell death. Furthermore, the researchers identified specific structural features of QACs that enhance their antimicrobial activity against MRSA. This knowledge could potentially guide the development of new QAC-based therapies for MRSA infections. The study also emphasized the importance of further research to fully understand the interactions between QACs and MRSA bacteria, paving the way for more effective treatment strategies in the future."

For each criterion, provide a score out of 10 and a brief comment. Remember the summary is supposed to be a 400-word high-level summary and will purposefully only discuss key findings while omitting specific details.Format the output as a JSON object with each criterion as a key, containing the score and comment. Additionally, provide an overall score out of 60.
