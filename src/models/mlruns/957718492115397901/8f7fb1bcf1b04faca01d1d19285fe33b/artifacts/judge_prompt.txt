**Original Abstracts:**
A novel series of steroidal β-carboline quaternary ammonium derivatives (SCQADs) derived from natural cholic acid and its derivatives was designed, synthesized and biologically evaluated against four Gram-positive bacteria for the first time. Most of these derivatives exhibited promising antibacterial activity against the tested strains, particularly, compound 21g displayed strong antibacterial activity against MRSA (MIC = 0.5-1 μg/mL) with low cytotoxicity. Meanwhile, derivative 21g was able to quickly kill Gram-positive bacteria within 0.5 h without inducing bacterial resistance. Preliminary mechanistic explorations indicated that compound 21g destroyed bacterial cell membranes to exert its antibacterial effects. Moreover, 21g exhibited high in vivo efficacy and high survival protection in a mouse skin abscess model. These findings suggested that compound 21g has great potential to develop as an antibacterial agent.

As the harm of benzalkyl dimethylammonium compounds (BACs) on human health and environment was discovered, alkyltrimethyl ammonium compound (ATMAC) and dialkyldimethyl ammonium compound (DADMAC), which belong to quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs), were likely to replace BACs as the main disinfectants. This study simulated the iterative use of QACs to explore their impact on resistance genes (RGs) in nitrification systems pre-contaminated by BACs. ATMAC could initiate and maintain partial nitrification. DADMAC generated higher levels of reactive oxygen species and lactate dehydrogenase, leading to increased biological toxicity in bacteria. The abundance of intracellular RGs of sludge was higher with the stress of QACs. DADMAC also induced higher extracellular polymeric substance secretion. Moreover, it facilitated the transfer of RGs from sludge to water, with ATMAC disseminating RGs through si-tnpA-04 and DADMAC through si-intI1. Sediminibacterium might be potential hosts for RGs. This study offered insights into disinfectant usage in the post-COVID-19 era.

Article 1:
Title: "Efficacy of Quaternary Ammonium Compounds Against MRSA"
Abstract: This study investigated the effectiveness of quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) in combating MRSA infections. The researchers conducted in vitro experiments using different concentrations of QACs and found that higher concentrations were more effective at killing MRSA. Additionally, they observed that QACs disrupted the cell membrane of MRSA, leading to cell death. These findings suggest that QACs could be a potential treatment option for MRSA infections.

Article 2:
Title: "Mechanism of Action of Quaternary Ammonium Compounds Against MRSA"
Abstract: This research focused on understanding the specific mechanism by which quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) combat MRSA. Through a series of biochemical assays and microscopy studies, the researchers discovered that QACs target the cell wall of MRSA, leading to membrane disruption and cell lysis. Furthermore, they identified key structural features of QACs that enhance their antimicrobial activity against MRSA. These findings provide valuable insights into the mode of action of QACs and could guide the development of more potent antimicrobial agents.

Summary: Research on quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) and their efficacy against MRSA has shown promising results. Studies have demonstrated that higher concentrations of QACs are more effective at killing MRSA by disrupting the cell membrane. Additionally, investigations into the mechanism of action of QACs have revealed that they target the cell wall of MRSA, leading to membrane disruption and cell lysis. These findings suggest that QACs could be a valuable treatment option for MRSA infections, and understanding their mode of action could aid in the development of more potent antimicrobial agents.

For each criterion, provide a score out of 10 and a brief comment. Remember the summary is supposed to be a 300-word high-level summary and will purposefully only discuss key findings while omitting specific details.Format the output as a JSON object with each criterion as a key, containing the score and comment. Additionally, provide an overall score out of 60.
