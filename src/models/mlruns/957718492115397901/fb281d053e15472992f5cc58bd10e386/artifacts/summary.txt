Research on quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) and their effectiveness against MRSA has shown promising results. One study found that QACs were able to effectively combat MRSA by disrupting the bacterial cell membrane, leading to cell death. Another study highlighted the importance of proper concentration and contact time of QACs in order to achieve maximum efficacy against MRSA. Additionally, research has shown that QACs have the potential to be used in various settings, such as hospitals and healthcare facilities, to help prevent the spread of MRSA infections. Overall, these findings suggest that QACs could be a valuable tool in the fight against antibiotic-resistant bacteria like MRSA.
