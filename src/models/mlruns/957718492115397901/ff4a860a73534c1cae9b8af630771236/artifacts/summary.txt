Several studies have investigated the effectiveness of quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) in combating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). One study found that QACs were able to effectively kill MRSA strains in both planktonic and biofilm forms. Another study utilized a combination of QACs and antibiotics to enhance the antibacterial activity against MRSA, showing promising results in reducing bacterial growth. These studies employed various methodologies such as minimum inhibitory concentration assays and biofilm formation assays to evaluate the efficacy of QACs. The findings suggest that QACs have the potential to be used as a valuable tool in combating MRSA infections, especially when used in combination with antibiotics. Further research is needed to explore the full potential of QACs in clinical settings and to address any potential resistance issues that may arise.
