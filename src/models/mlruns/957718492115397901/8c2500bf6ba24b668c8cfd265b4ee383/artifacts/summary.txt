Article 1 explores the effectiveness of quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) in combating MRSA, highlighting their ability to disrupt the cell membrane and inhibit bacterial growth. The study conducted in vitro experiments to demonstrate the bactericidal activity of QACs against MRSA strains. Article 2 investigates the use of QACs in healthcare settings to control MRSA contamination, emphasizing their role in surface disinfection and preventing the spread of infections. The research involved field studies in hospitals to assess the impact of QACs on reducing MRSA transmission. Overall, both articles underscore the significance of QACs in combating MRSA through their antimicrobial properties and potential applications in infection control strategies.
