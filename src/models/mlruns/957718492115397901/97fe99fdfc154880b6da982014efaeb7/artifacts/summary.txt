Several studies have investigated the effectiveness of quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) in combating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). One study found that QACs were able to effectively kill MRSA strains, with higher concentrations leading to greater efficacy. Another study explored the use of QACs in combination with other disinfectants, finding that the combination was more effective in reducing MRSA levels compared to using QACs alone. Methodologies in these studies included in vitro testing of QACs on MRSA strains and assessing bacterial growth inhibition. The implications of these findings suggest that QACs could be a valuable tool in controlling MRSA infections, especially when used in combination with other disinfectants. Further research is needed to determine the most effective concentrations and applications of QACs in combating MRSA.
