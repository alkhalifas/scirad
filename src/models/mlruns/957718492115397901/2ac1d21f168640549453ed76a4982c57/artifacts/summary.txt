Article 1: "Antibacterial activity of quaternary ammonium compounds against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: a mechanistic study" 
This study investigated the antibacterial activity of quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The researchers found that QACs effectively inhibited the growth of MRSA by disrupting the bacterial cell membrane and causing leakage of intracellular contents. The study also highlighted the importance of the alkyl chain length and structure of QACs in determining their antimicrobial efficacy. These findings suggest that QACs could be a promising strategy for combating MRSA infections.

Article 2: "Synergistic effect of quaternary ammonium compounds and antibiotics against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus" 
This research focused on the synergistic effect of quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) in combination with antibiotics against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The study demonstrated that the combination of QACs and antibiotics resulted in enhanced antibacterial activity against MRSA compared to either treatment alone. The researchers also observed that QACs could help restore the susceptibility of MRSA to antibiotics, potentially overcoming antibiotic resistance. These findings suggest that the use of QACs in combination with antibiotics could be a promising approach for treating MRSA infections.
