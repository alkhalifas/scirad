Research on quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) and their effectiveness against MRSA has shown promising results. Studies have demonstrated that QACs are effective in combating MRSA by disrupting the bacterial cell membrane, leading to cell death. Various methodologies, including in vitro and in vivo experiments, have been used to assess the efficacy of QACs against MRSA strains. The findings suggest that QACs have the potential to be used as a disinfectant in healthcare settings to control MRSA infections. The implications of this research are significant as MRSA poses a serious threat to public health, and finding effective ways to combat it is crucial. Further research is needed to explore the full potential of QACs in combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria like MRSA.
