Research on quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) and their effectiveness against MRSA has shown promising results. Studies have demonstrated that QACs can effectively combat MRSA by disrupting the bacterial cell membrane and inhibiting its growth. Various methodologies, including in vitro and in vivo experiments, have been used to assess the efficacy of QACs against MRSA. The findings suggest that QACs have the potential to be used as a viable treatment option for MRSA infections, especially in healthcare settings where antibiotic resistance is a growing concern. Further research is needed to explore the full potential of QACs in combating MRSA and other antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
