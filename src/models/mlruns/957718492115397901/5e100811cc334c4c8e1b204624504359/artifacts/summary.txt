Recent research on quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) has shown their effectiveness in combating MRSA, a drug-resistant bacterium. Studies have demonstrated that QACs can effectively kill MRSA by disrupting its cell membrane and inhibiting its growth. Various methodologies, including in vitro and in vivo experiments, have been used to evaluate the efficacy of QACs against MRSA. The findings suggest that QACs could be a promising solution for controlling MRSA infections in healthcare settings. This research highlights the potential of QACs as a valuable tool in the fight against antibiotic-resistant bacteria like MRSA, offering new possibilities for infection control and prevention strategies.
