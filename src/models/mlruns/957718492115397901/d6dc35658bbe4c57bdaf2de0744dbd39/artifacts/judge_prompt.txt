**Original Abstracts:**
A novel series of steroidal β-carboline quaternary ammonium derivatives (SCQADs) derived from natural cholic acid and its derivatives was designed, synthesized and biologically evaluated against four Gram-positive bacteria for the first time. Most of these derivatives exhibited promising antibacterial activity against the tested strains, particularly, compound 21g displayed strong antibacterial activity against MRSA (MIC = 0.5-1 μg/mL) with low cytotoxicity. Meanwhile, derivative 21g was able to quickly kill Gram-positive bacteria within 0.5 h without inducing bacterial resistance. Preliminary mechanistic explorations indicated that compound 21g destroyed bacterial cell membranes to exert its antibacterial effects. Moreover, 21g exhibited high in vivo efficacy and high survival protection in a mouse skin abscess model. These findings suggested that compound 21g has great potential to develop as an antibacterial agent.

As the harm of benzalkyl dimethylammonium compounds (BACs) on human health and environment was discovered, alkyltrimethyl ammonium compound (ATMAC) and dialkyldimethyl ammonium compound (DADMAC), which belong to quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs), were likely to replace BACs as the main disinfectants. This study simulated the iterative use of QACs to explore their impact on resistance genes (RGs) in nitrification systems pre-contaminated by BACs. ATMAC could initiate and maintain partial nitrification. DADMAC generated higher levels of reactive oxygen species and lactate dehydrogenase, leading to increased biological toxicity in bacteria. The abundance of intracellular RGs of sludge was higher with the stress of QACs. DADMAC also induced higher extracellular polymeric substance secretion. Moreover, it facilitated the transfer of RGs from sludge to water, with ATMAC disseminating RGs through si-tnpA-04 and DADMAC through si-intI1. Sediminibacterium might be potential hosts for RGs. This study offered insights into disinfectant usage in the post-COVID-19 era.

Article 1:
Title: "Antimicrobial activity of quaternary ammonium compounds against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus"
Abstract: This study investigated the effectiveness of quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The researchers found that QACs exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against MRSA strains, with some compounds showing even greater efficacy than traditional antibiotics. The study utilized a combination of in vitro assays and animal models to demonstrate the effectiveness of QACs in combating MRSA infections.

Article 2:
Title: "Mechanisms of action of quaternary ammonium compounds against Staphylococcus aureus"
Abstract: This research delved into the mechanisms by which quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) exert their antimicrobial effects against Staphylococcus aureus. The study revealed that QACs disrupt the bacterial cell membrane integrity, leading to cell death. Additionally, the researchers identified specific molecular targets within the bacterial cell that are affected by QACs, shedding light on the precise mechanisms of action of these compounds. The findings of this study have important implications for the development of novel antimicrobial agents targeting MRSA.

Summary: Research on quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) has shown promising results in combating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. Studies have demonstrated the potent antimicrobial activity of QACs against MRSA strains, with some compounds outperforming traditional antibiotics. Furthermore, investigations into the mechanisms of action of QACs have revealed their ability to disrupt bacterial cell membranes and target specific molecular components within Staphylococcus aureus. These findings provide valuable insights for the development of new antimicrobial agents to combat MRSA infections.

For each criterion, provide a score out of 10 and a brief comment.
