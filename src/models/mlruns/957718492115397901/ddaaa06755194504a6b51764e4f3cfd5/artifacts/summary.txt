Several studies have investigated the effectiveness of quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) in combating MRSA. One study found that QACs were able to effectively kill MRSA strains, with higher concentrations leading to increased efficacy. Another study utilized a novel approach by combining QACs with silver nanoparticles, resulting in enhanced antimicrobial activity against MRSA. The methodologies in these studies involved testing different concentrations of QACs and assessing their antimicrobial effects on MRSA through various assays. The implications of these findings suggest that QACs, particularly when combined with other antimicrobial agents, could serve as a promising strategy for combating MRSA infections in healthcare settings.
