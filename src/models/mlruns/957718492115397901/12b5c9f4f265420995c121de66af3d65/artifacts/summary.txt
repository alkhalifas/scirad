Several studies have investigated the effectiveness of quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) in combating Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). One study found that QACs were successful in reducing MRSA contamination on surfaces in healthcare settings. The researchers utilized a combination of QAC-based disinfectants and cleaning protocols to achieve significant reductions in MRSA levels. Another study focused on the potential for QACs to be used in hand sanitizers to combat MRSA transmission. The researchers found that hand sanitizers containing QACs were effective in reducing MRSA on hands. These findings suggest that QACs have a promising role in controlling MRSA spread in healthcare settings. Further research is needed to explore the full potential of QACs in combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria like MRSA.
