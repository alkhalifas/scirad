Article 1: "Antimicrobial activity of quaternary ammonium compounds against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: A systematic review" 
Summary: The article reviews the antimicrobial activity of quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The study found that QACs are effective in combating MRSA, with various formulations showing significant antimicrobial properties. The research utilized a systematic review approach to analyze the existing literature on QACs and their efficacy against MRSA. The findings suggest that QACs can be a valuable tool in controlling MRSA infections and reducing the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

Article 2: "Mechanisms of action of quaternary ammonium compounds against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus" 
Summary: This article investigates the mechanisms of action of quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The study identified that QACs disrupt the cell membrane of MRSA, leading to cell death and inhibiting bacterial growth. The research employed various molecular and biochemical techniques to elucidate the specific interactions between QACs and MRSA. The findings provide valuable insights into the antimicrobial properties of QACs and offer potential strategies for developing new treatments against antibiotic-resistant bacteria like MRSA.
