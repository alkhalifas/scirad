Research on quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) has shown their effectiveness in combating MRSA, a drug-resistant bacterium. Studies have demonstrated that QACs disrupt the cell membrane of MRSA, leading to cell death. The antimicrobial activity of QACs was tested using various concentrations and exposure times, with promising results in inhibiting MRSA growth. Furthermore, QACs were found to have a broad spectrum of activity against other bacteria and fungi, making them a versatile option for infection control. These findings suggest that QACs could be a valuable tool in the fight against drug-resistant pathogens like MRSA, highlighting the importance of further research on their efficacy and safety for clinical use.
