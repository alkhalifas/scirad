Multiple studies have been conducted to investigate the impact of carbon emissions on climate change and global warming trends. One study utilized climate models to project future temperature changes based on different emission scenarios, finding that continued high emissions would lead to significant warming and associated impacts. Another study focused on the role of carbon emissions from fossil fuels in driving global warming trends, highlighting the need for immediate action to reduce emissions and mitigate climate change. These studies underscore the urgent need for global cooperation to address carbon emissions and limit the impacts of climate change on the planet.
