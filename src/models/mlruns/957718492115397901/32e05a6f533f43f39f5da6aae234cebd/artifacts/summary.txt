Researchers have been studying the effectiveness of quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) in combating MRSA, a drug-resistant bacterium. One study found that QACs were able to effectively kill MRSA in laboratory settings by disrupting the bacterial cell membrane. Another study focused on the use of QAC-coated surfaces in healthcare settings to reduce MRSA transmission. The researchers found that these surfaces were successful in reducing MRSA contamination and transmission rates. Overall, these studies highlight the potential of QACs in fighting against MRSA and suggest that incorporating QAC-based products in healthcare settings could help prevent the spread of this dangerous bacterium.
