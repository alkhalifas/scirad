Research on quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) has shown promising results in combating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. The studies reviewed various QACs and their effectiveness in inhibiting MRSA growth, with some compounds demonstrating significant antimicrobial activity. Methodologies included in vitro experiments testing the minimum inhibitory concentration of QACs against MRSA strains. The implications of these findings suggest that QACs could be a valuable tool in the fight against MRSA infections, especially in healthcare settings where antibiotic resistance is a growing concern. Further research is needed to explore the potential of QACs as alternative treatments for MRSA infections and to optimize their efficacy in clinical settings.
