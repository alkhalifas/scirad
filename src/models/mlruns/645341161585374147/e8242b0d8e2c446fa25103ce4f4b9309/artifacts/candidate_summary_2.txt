1. **Leveraging Large Language Models and Agent-Based Systems for Scientific Data Analysis: Validation Study**: This study introduces the LITURAt system, which employs an agent-based architecture to enhance the application of large language models in scientific data analysis. By integrating external data retrieval and analysis tools, LITURAt addresses challenges of factual accuracy and domain-specific precision, making scientific information more accessible. The key finding is the system's ability to produce reliable, context-aware outputs, bridging the gap between complex scientific data and user-friendly communication.

2. **Constraining an Unconstrained Multi-agent Policy with Offline Data**: The CUTMAP method is proposed to address constraints in multi-agent decision-making systems, particularly when online learning is impractical. This approach utilizes offline data within a multi-agent maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework, allowing for scalable optimization and constraint satisfaction. The study highlights the importance of centralized training with decentralized execution, offering a solution to dynamically incorporate new constraints during policy execution.

3. **Measuring Water Pollution Effects on Antimicrobial Resistance through Explainable Artificial Intelligence**: This research employs explainable AI to assess the impact of water pollution on antimicrobial resistance. Using the One Health framework, the study identifies key indicators affecting resistance-related mortality across different countries. The findings emphasize the critical role of water quality and accessibility, suggesting AI's potential as a decision-support tool in public health.
