The scientific articles reviewed here focus on the development and application of agent and multi-agent frameworks within artificial intelligence (AI) models and systems, highlighting key findings, methodologies, and implications.

1. **Leveraging Large Language Models and Agent-Based Systems for Scientific Data Analysis: Validation Study**: This study introduces the LITURAt system, which employs an agent-based architecture to enhance the factual accuracy and domain-specific precision of large language models in scientific data analysis. By integrating external data retrieval and analysis tools, LITURAt produces reliable, context-aware outputs, facilitating the accessibility of scientific information for both experts and non-experts. This approach underscores the potential of combining agent-based systems with AI to address limitations in data accuracy and precision, particularly in scientific domains.

2. **Constraining an Unconstrained Multi-agent Policy with Offline Data**: The article presents CUTMAP, a novel method for constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning (CMARL). This approach uses offline data to train multi-agent systems, addressing challenges like safety restrictions and the absence of high-fidelity simulators in online learning. By employing a centralized training with decentralized execution paradigm, CUTMAP efficiently handles new constraints that emerge during policy execution. This methodology highlights the importance of scalable optimization within multi-agent frameworks to ensure policy compliance with dynamic constraints.

3. **Measuring Water Pollution Effects on Antimicrobial Resistance through Explainable Artificial Intelligence**: This research utilizes explainable AI within the One Health framework to assess factors influencing antimicrobial resistance. The study identifies water accessibility and quality as critical indicators affecting mortality due to resistance in various pathogens. The integration of AI in this context demonstrates its potential as a decision-support tool, emphasizing the role of AI frameworks in addressing complex, global health challenges.

Overall, these articles illustrate the diverse applications and advantages of agent and multi-agent frameworks in enhancing the performance and reliability of AI systems across different domains, from scientific data analysis to reinforcement learning and public health.
