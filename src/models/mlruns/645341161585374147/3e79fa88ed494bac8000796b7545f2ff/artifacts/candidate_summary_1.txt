The two relevant scientific articles focus on agent-based frameworks and multi-agent systems in artificial intelligence, each contributing uniquely to the field.

The first article, "Leveraging Large Language Models and Agent-Based Systems for Scientific Data Analysis: Validation Study," explores the integration of large language models with agent-based systems to enhance scientific data analysis. The study introduces the LITURAt system, which employs an agent-based architecture to address the challenges of factual accuracy and domain-specific precision in scientific domains. By incorporating external data retrieval and analysis tools, LITURAt ensures reliable and context-aware outputs, making scientific information more accessible to both experts and nonexperts. This methodology signifies a significant advancement in the application of AI in scientific analysis, showcasing the potential of agent-based systems to enhance the precision and reliability of language models in specialized fields.

The second article, "Constraining an Unconstrained Multi-agent Policy with Offline Data," presents a novel approach to Constrained Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (CMARL) through the CUTMAP framework. This method addresses the limitations of online learning in multi-agent systems by utilizing offline data to enforce constraints. The study follows the centralized training with decentralized execution paradigm and integrates a scalable optimization objective within the framework of multi-agent maximum entropy reinforcement learning. By leveraging an unconstrained prior policy, the approach estimates a decomposable Q-function, allowing for more flexible and adaptable policy training. This innovative methodology has significant implications for real-world applications, where safety restrictions and dynamic constraints pose challenges to online learning in multi-agent systems.

Both articles underscore the transformative potential of agent-based frameworks in artificial intelligence, highlighting methodologies that enhance the adaptability, precision, and applicability of AI models in complex and constrained environments. These advancements pave the way for more robust and context-aware AI systems, with broad implications for scientific research and multi-agent decision-making processes.
