The collection of scientific articles highlights the transformative role of CRISPR technology in genomics and biotechnology, showcasing its diverse applications across various organisms and contexts. In the realm of porcine embryos, CRISPR/Cas9 has been pivotal in genetic modifications, with methodologies like somatic cell nuclear transfer and microinjection being explored. Despite challenges such as off-target effects and mosaicism, advancements in these techniques are crucial for agricultural and biomedical applications.

In plant genomics, CRISPR-mediated prime editing has been effectively utilized for in situ epitope tagging in rice, enhancing gene function studies and genetic improvements. The development of the NM-PE strategy, which employs SpCas9 and microhomology-mediated end joining, has streamlined gene tagging processes, broadening the scope of genetic modifications in rice.

The exploration of novel cytidine deaminases for base editing in rice has expanded the capabilities of CRISPR-based cytosine base editors, allowing for precise C-to-T conversions with minimal off-target effects. This advancement is significant for multiplexed base editing, offering a robust tool for genetic engineering in plants.

In synthetic biology, the EXPERT system has enhanced prime editing by enabling large fragment edits, overcoming limitations of traditional prime editors. This system's ability to efficiently edit both sides of the pegRNA nick without increasing off-target effects marks a significant leap in genome editing technology.

CRISPR technology has also been applied in medical biotechnology, as demonstrated by the targeting of BCL11B in CAR-engineered lymphoid progenitors, which enhances anti-leukemic activity. Additionally, CRISPR/Cas9 editing in maize has altered phenolic metabolism, optimizing lignin structure for biorefining applications.

Overall, these studies underscore CRISPR's versatility and potential in advancing genomics and biotechnology, paving the way for innovative solutions in agriculture, medicine, and industrial applications. The ongoing refinement of CRISPR methodologies promises to unlock further possibilities in genetic engineering and synthetic biology.
