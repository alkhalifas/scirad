The exploration of CRISPR technology in genomics and its applications in biotechnology is advancing rapidly, as evidenced by recent studies. CRISPR/Cas9 has been pivotal in gene editing, especially in porcine embryos, highlighting methodologies like somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) and sperm-mediated gene transfer (SMGT). Despite its transformative potential, challenges such as off-target effects and mosaicism persist, necessitating methodological refinements for agricultural and biomedical applications.

In plant genomics, CRISPR-based prime editing has been effectively utilized for in situ epitope tagging in rice, with the SpCas9 nuclease/microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ)-based prime editing (NM-PE) showing improved efficiency over conventional methods. This has implications for gene function studies and genetic improvement in crops. Similarly, the development of the EXPERT system extends the editing capabilities of prime editors, enabling efficient large fragment edits without increasing off-target effects, thus enhancing the tool's utility in life sciences.

CRISPR/Cas9 has also been employed to engineer cytosine base editors (CBEs) by harnessing novel cytidine deaminases from the animal kingdom, broadening the scope of multiplexed base editing in rice. This approach demonstrates high editing efficiency and minimal off-target effects, crucial for precise genetic modifications.

In synthetic biology, CRISPR technology has facilitated the design of molecular proximity sensors and CAR-engineered lymphoid progenitors, providing insights into anti-leukemic functionality and synthetic molecular circuits. Additionally, CRISPR-mediated editing of genes in pathogens like Fusarium circinatum and maize has revealed significant implications for pathogenicity and lignin metabolism, respectively, showcasing the potential for agricultural and industrial biotechnology advancements.

Lastly, CRISPR technology has been instrumental in understanding the alkaline resistance mechanisms in Halomonas alkalicola through proteomic and metabolomic analyses, highlighting its role in industrial biotechnology and environmental applications. Collectively, these studies underscore CRISPR's transformative impact across various domains, driving innovations in genomics and biotechnology.
