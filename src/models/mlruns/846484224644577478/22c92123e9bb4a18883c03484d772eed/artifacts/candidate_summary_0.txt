The scientific articles reviewed here explore various applications of agent-based frameworks and artificial intelligence (AI) in different domains, highlighting their methodologies, key findings, and implications.

The first article, "Leveraging Large Language Models and Agent-Based Systems for Scientific Data Analysis," discusses the LITURAt system, which integrates large language models with an agent-based architecture to enhance scientific data analysis. This system addresses challenges of factual accuracy and domain-specific precision by employing external data retrieval and analysis tools. The key finding is that LITURAt can produce reliable, context-aware outputs, making scientific information more accessible to both experts and non-experts. This approach underscores the potential of agent-based systems in improving the accuracy and usability of AI models in scientific domains.

The second article, "Measuring water pollution effects on antimicrobial resistance through explainable artificial intelligence," employs an explainable AI framework to assess the impact of water pollution on antimicrobial resistance. By using a comprehensive set of indicators from the One Health framework, the study identifies water accessibility and quality as critical factors influencing mortality due to antimicrobial resistance. This research highlights the importance of explainable AI in understanding complex environmental and health interactions, providing valuable insights for decision-making and policy development.

The remaining articles, while not directly focused on agent-based frameworks, illustrate the broader application of AI in healthcare and scientific research. For instance, the "Smart Pharmaceutical Monitoring System" article discusses the development of an AI-driven system for personalized medication management in diabetes care, emphasizing the role of AI in enhancing treatment adherence and patient outcomes.

Overall, these studies demonstrate the transformative potential of agent-based frameworks and AI in various fields, from scientific data analysis to healthcare, by improving accuracy, accessibility, and decision-making processes. The integration of AI with agent-based systems offers promising avenues for addressing complex challenges across diverse domains.
