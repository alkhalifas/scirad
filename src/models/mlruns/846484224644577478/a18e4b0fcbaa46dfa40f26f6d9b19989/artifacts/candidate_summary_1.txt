The selected articles focus on the development and application of quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) and their derivatives to combat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and other antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Key findings and methodologies from these studies highlight the innovative approaches and implications of using QACs in antimicrobial therapy.

1. **Bushy-Tailed Multicationic Quaternary Phosphonium Compounds**: This study explores quaternary phosphonium compounds (QPCs) as alternatives to traditional QACs. By synthesizing "bushy-tailed" QPCs with multiple short alkyl or aryl chains, researchers achieved potent antimicrobial activity with low mammalian toxicity. Select derivatives demonstrated superior efficacy against a range of bacteria compared to traditional QACs, suggesting their potential as effective disinfectants with favorable therapeutic indices.

2. **Gemini Quaternary Ammonium-Functionalized Peptide Nanoassemblies**: This research focuses on enhancing antimicrobial resistance therapy by conjugating gemini QACs with hexapeptides to form cationic antimicrobial nanomaterials. These nanoassemblies exhibit multiple antibacterial mechanisms, low cytotoxicity, and minimal resistance development, offering a promising route for combating resistant bacterial infections.

3. **Quaternization of Pleuromutilins**: The modification of lefamulin, a pleuromutilin antibiotic, through quaternization improved its pharmacokinetics and organ targeting. By incorporating quaternary ammonium groups, the study enhanced the drug's ability to target liver and kidney tissues, potentially improving treatment outcomes for multidrug-resistant infections.

4. **Sulfonium-based Polymethacrylamides**: Although not directly related to QACs, this study investigates sulfonium groups as alternatives to ammonium-based cations in antimicrobial polymers. These polymers disrupt bacterial membranes through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, broadening the scope of polymeric antimicrobial agents.

These studies collectively underscore the potential of QACs and their derivatives in addressing antimicrobial resistance, particularly against MRSA. By exploring novel structures and conjugations, researchers aim to enhance the efficacy and safety of antimicrobial agents, paving the way for innovative therapeutic strategies in infection control.
