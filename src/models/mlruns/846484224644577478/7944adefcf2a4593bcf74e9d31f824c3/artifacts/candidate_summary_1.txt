The scientific articles reviewed focus on the integration of agent-based frameworks and artificial intelligence (AI) models across various domains, highlighting the transformative potential of these technologies.

The study "Leveraging Large Language Models and Agent-Based Systems for Scientific Data Analysis" introduces the LITURAt system, which employs an agent-based architecture to enhance the application of large language models in scientific data analysis. This framework addresses the common challenges of factual accuracy and domain precision by incorporating external data retrieval and analysis tools. The key finding is that LITURAt can produce reliable, context-aware outputs, making scientific information more accessible to both experts and nonexperts.

In "Measuring water pollution effects on antimicrobial resistance through explainable artificial intelligence," AI is used to explore the impact of water pollution on antimicrobial resistance. By leveraging the One Health framework, the study identifies critical indicators affecting resistance, emphasizing the importance of water quality. The use of explainable AI provides transparency, offering a decision-support tool for monitoring and policymaking.

The article on "Smart Pharmaceutical Monitoring System" discusses a personalized AI-driven system for diabetes management. The framework integrates personalized medication schedules and self-management programs, addressing issues like treatment complexity and poor adherence. This approach underscores the potential of AI to enhance patient outcomes through tailored interventions.

While the other articles do not specifically focus on agent-based frameworks, they contribute to the broader discourse on AI in healthcare and scientific research. Collectively, these studies demonstrate the significant implications of integrating agent-based systems and AI frameworks in various fields. They highlight the potential for improved accuracy, personalized solutions, and enhanced decision-making, suggesting a future where AI-driven frameworks could revolutionize data analysis, healthcare management, and scientific research.
