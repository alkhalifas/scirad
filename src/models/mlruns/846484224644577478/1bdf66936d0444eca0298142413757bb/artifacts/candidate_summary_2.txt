The scientific articles reviewed focus on the integration of agent-based frameworks and artificial intelligence (AI) models in various domains, highlighting their methodologies, key findings, and implications.

The article "Leveraging Large Language Models and Agent-Based Systems for Scientific Data Analysis: Validation Study" explores the use of large language models (LLMs) in scientific data analysis. The study introduces the LITURAt system, which employs an agent-based architecture to enhance the factual accuracy and domain-specific precision of LLMs. By integrating external data retrieval and analysis tools, LITURAt ensures reliable and context-aware outputs, making scientific information more accessible to both experts and non-experts. This approach addresses the limitations of LLMs in scientific domains, emphasizing the potential of agent-based systems to improve AI applications in data analysis.

In "Measuring water pollution effects on antimicrobial resistance through explainable artificial intelligence," the authors utilize explainable AI to assess the impact of water pollution on antimicrobial resistance. The study employs the One Health framework to analyze various indicators affecting antimicrobial resistance across different countries. The findings highlight the critical role of water accessibility and quality in determining mortality rates due to antimicrobial resistance. This research underscores the importance of AI in identifying key factors influencing health outcomes and offers a decision-support tool for monitoring and managing antimicrobial resistance.

Overall, these articles demonstrate the significant role of agent-based frameworks and AI in enhancing the precision and applicability of scientific models and systems. By leveraging sophisticated architectures and explainable AI, these studies provide valuable insights into improving data analysis, health monitoring, and decision-making processes across diverse fields. The integration of AI and agent-based systems holds promise for advancing scientific research and addressing complex challenges in various domains.
