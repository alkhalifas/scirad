The scientific articles reviewed here explore various applications of agent-based frameworks and artificial intelligence (AI) in different domains, highlighting their methodologies, key findings, and implications.

The first article, "Leveraging Large Language Models and Agent-Based Systems for Scientific Data Analysis," discusses the LITURAt system, which integrates large language models with an agent-based architecture to enhance scientific data analysis. This system addresses challenges of factual accuracy and domain-specific precision by employing external data retrieval and analysis tools. The key finding is that LITURAt can produce reliable, context-aware outputs, making scientific information more accessible to both experts and nonexperts. This has significant implications for improving the accuracy and accessibility of scientific communication.

The second article, "Measuring water pollution effects on antimicrobial resistance through explainable artificial intelligence," employs an explainable AI framework to assess the impact of water pollution on antimicrobial resistance. By using a large set of indicators from the One Health framework, the study identifies water accessibility and quality as critical factors influencing mortality due to antimicrobial resistance. This research highlights the potential of AI as a decision-support tool in public health, emphasizing the importance of environmental factors in managing antimicrobial resistance.

The remaining articles, while not directly focused on agent-based frameworks or AI, provide context for the broader application of these technologies. For instance, the "Smart Pharmaceutical Monitoring System" article discusses the use of AI in developing personalized medication schedules for diabetes patients, showcasing the potential of AI in healthcare management.

Overall, these studies underscore the transformative potential of agent-based systems and AI frameworks in enhancing data analysis, decision-making, and personalized healthcare. They highlight the importance of integrating domain-specific knowledge and external data sources to improve the accuracy and applicability of AI models across various fields.
