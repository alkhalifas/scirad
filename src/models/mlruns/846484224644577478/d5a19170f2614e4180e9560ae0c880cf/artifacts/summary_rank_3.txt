The first article discusses the application of evolutionary multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) in group social dilemmas, focusing on Q-learning within public goods games. This framework enables the study of cooperation issues like the tragedy of the commons and free-rider effects in artificial intelligence (AI). The research bridges traditional and evolutionary game theory by examining agents with intermediate intelligence levels, exploring the impact of learning parameters and evolutionary pressures on cooperation. The study identifies conditions that influence exploration rates and attractor values, enhancing the understanding of combining evolutionary algorithms with Q-learning and extending insights into AI behavior in social dilemmas.

The second article introduces a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for cross-domain sequential recommendation (MARL4CDSR), addressing challenges in sequential recommendation models, particularly data sparsity and misalignment of user interests across domains. The proposed framework uses agents to select relevant items from source domain sequences for transfer, optimizing the process through coordinated strategies within a multi-agent RL framework. An information fusion module with a cross-attention mechanism aligns source and target domain item representations. Evaluated on Amazon domains (Movies_and_TV, Toys_and_Games, Books), MARL4CDSR outperforms baselines, notably improving NDCG@10 and HR@10 by 14.76% and 10.25%, respectively, in the Movies&Booksâ†’Toys task. This framework effectively enhances recommendation accuracy in data-sparse target domains by leveraging cross-domain data and optimizing transfer strategies.
