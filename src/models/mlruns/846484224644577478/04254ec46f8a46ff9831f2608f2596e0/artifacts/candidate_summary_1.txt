The scientific articles reviewed focus on the integration of agent-based frameworks and artificial intelligence (AI) models in various domains, highlighting their methodologies, key findings, and implications.

The article "Leveraging Large Language Models and Agent-Based Systems for Scientific Data Analysis: Validation Study" explores the use of large language models (LLMs) in scientific data analysis. The study introduces the LITURAt system, which employs an agent-based architecture to enhance the factual accuracy and domain-specific precision of LLMs. By integrating external data retrieval and analysis tools, LITURAt ensures context-aware outputs, making scientific information more accessible to both experts and nonexperts. This approach addresses the limitations of LLMs in scientific domains, emphasizing the potential of agent-based systems to improve AI model reliability and applicability.

In "Measuring water pollution effects on antimicrobial resistance through explainable artificial intelligence," the authors utilize explainable AI to assess the impact of water pollution on antimicrobial resistance. The study employs the One Health framework to analyze various indicators affecting antimicrobial resistance across different countries. The findings underscore the critical role of water quality and accessibility in determining mortality rates due to resistant pathogens. This research highlights the importance of AI frameworks in identifying key environmental factors and providing decision support for public health interventions.

The articles collectively demonstrate the transformative potential of agent-based frameworks and AI models in enhancing data analysis, decision-making, and system reliability across diverse scientific and medical fields. By leveraging these technologies, researchers can address complex challenges, improve precision, and facilitate informed decision-making, ultimately advancing the capabilities and applications of AI in scientific and healthcare domains.
