The scientific articles reviewed focus on the integration of agent-based frameworks and artificial intelligence (AI) models in various domains, highlighting their methodologies, key findings, and implications.

The article "Leveraging Large Language Models and Agent-Based Systems for Scientific Data Analysis: Validation Study" explores the use of large language models (LLMs) in scientific data analysis. The study introduces the LITURAt system, which employs an agent-based architecture to enhance the factual accuracy and domain-specific precision of LLMs. By integrating external data retrieval and analysis tools, LITURAt ensures reliable and context-aware outputs, making scientific information more accessible to both experts and non-experts. This approach addresses the limitations of LLMs in scientific domains, emphasizing the potential of agent-based systems to improve AI applications in data analysis.

In "Measuring water pollution effects on antimicrobial resistance through explainable artificial intelligence," the authors utilize explainable AI to assess the impact of water pollution on antimicrobial resistance. The study employs the One Health framework to predict mortality related to antimicrobial resistance across different pathogens. The findings underscore the critical role of water accessibility and quality indicators in determining resistance-related mortality, suggesting that AI can serve as a decision-support tool for monitoring and addressing antimicrobial resistance.

The "Smart Pharmaceutical Monitoring System With Personalized Medication Schedules and Self-Management Programs for Patients With Diabetes" article discusses the development of a smart monitoring system using AI to manage diabetes treatment. The system aims to improve patient adherence and treatment outcomes by providing personalized medication schedules and self-management programs. This study highlights the potential of AI in enhancing healthcare delivery and patient management in chronic disease contexts.

Overall, these articles demonstrate the transformative potential of agent-based frameworks and AI models in scientific data analysis, healthcare, and environmental monitoring. They emphasize the importance of integrating domain-specific knowledge and external data sources to enhance the accuracy and applicability of AI systems across various fields.
