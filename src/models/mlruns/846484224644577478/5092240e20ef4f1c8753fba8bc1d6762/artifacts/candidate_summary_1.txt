The scientific articles reviewed here highlight the integration of agent-based frameworks and artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies across various domains, underscoring their potential to enhance data analysis, healthcare, and environmental monitoring.

The first article, "Leveraging Large Language Models and Agent-Based Systems for Scientific Data Analysis: Validation Study," introduces the LITURAt system, which employs an agent-based architecture to enhance the accuracy and context-awareness of large language models (LLMs) in scientific domains. This system addresses the challenges of factual accuracy and domain-specific precision by integrating external data retrieval and analysis tools, making scientific data more accessible to diverse audiences. The study demonstrates the potential of agent-based systems to improve the reliability of AI outputs in complex scientific analyses.

In contrast, the article "Measuring water pollution effects on antimicrobial resistance through explainable artificial intelligence" utilizes an explainable AI framework to assess the impact of water quality on antimicrobial resistance. By employing a large set of indicators within the One Health framework, the study identifies key factors influencing resistance in pathogens across different countries. This approach highlights the importance of environmental factors in public health and suggests the use of AI as a decision-support tool for monitoring antimicrobial resistance.

Both articles underscore the transformative role of agent-based frameworks and AI in enhancing the precision and applicability of complex data analyses. The LITURAt system exemplifies how agent-based architectures can mitigate limitations of LLMs, while the explainable AI study illustrates the potential of AI to address global health challenges like antimicrobial resistance. These advancements have significant implications for improving scientific communication, healthcare decision-making, and environmental monitoring, demonstrating the versatility and impact of agent-based and AI frameworks across diverse fields.
