The reviewed scientific articles discuss various applications and implications of agent-based and multiagent frameworks in artificial intelligence (AI) models and systems, with a focus on enhancing accuracy, efficiency, and applicability in diverse domains.

1. **Leveraging Large Language Models and Agent-Based Systems for Scientific Data Analysis**: This study highlights the LITURAt system, which integrates large language models with an agent-based architecture to improve scientific data analysis. The system addresses challenges of factual accuracy and domain-specific precision by employing external data retrieval and analysis tools. This approach ensures reliable and context-aware outputs, making scientific information more accessible to both experts and non-experts. The key implication is the potential for agent-based systems to enhance the usability and reliability of AI in scientific domains.

2. **Measuring Water Pollution Effects on Antimicrobial Resistance through Explainable Artificial Intelligence**: This research uses explainable AI within the One Health framework to assess factors influencing antimicrobial resistance. By analyzing water quality indicators' impact on resistance-related mortality across different countries, the study underscores the importance of environmental factors in public health. The findings suggest that agent-based frameworks can provide valuable decision support and monitoring tools for addressing global health challenges.

3. **Smart Pharmaceutical Monitoring System for Diabetes Management**: The study explores a smart monitoring system utilizing AI to personalize medication schedules for diabetes patients. While not explicitly agent-based, the system's emphasis on personalized, adaptive management reflects principles akin to multiagent systems, where AI tailors interventions to individual patient needs. This approach could improve treatment adherence and outcomes, highlighting AI's potential in healthcare personalization.

Overall, these studies illustrate the transformative potential of agent-based and multiagent frameworks in enhancing AI applications across scientific research, healthcare, and environmental monitoring. By improving precision, adaptability, and accessibility, these frameworks can significantly impact decision-making and problem-solving in complex, dynamic environments.
