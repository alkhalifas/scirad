The reviewed articles explore the development and application of quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) and their derivatives in combating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and other antimicrobial-resistant infections. The first article discusses the synthesis of multicationic quaternary phosphonium compounds (QPCs), which are structurally distinct from traditional QACs. These "bushy-tailed" QPCs, with multiple short alkyl or aryl chains, exhibit superior antimicrobial activity and lower toxicity compared to conventional QACs, suggesting their potential as effective disinfectants.

The second article introduces self-assembling gemini quaternary ammonium-functionalized peptide nanoassemblies. These materials combine antimicrobial QACs with designed peptides to create cationic nanomaterials exhibiting multiple antibacterial mechanisms, low cytotoxicity, and minimal resistance development, making them promising candidates for treating antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections.

In the third article, the modification of lefamulin, a pleuromutilin antibiotic, through quaternization and the incorporation of a quaternary ammonium group is explored. This modification enhances the antibiotic's pharmacological properties, including improved targeting of liver and kidney tissues, which could be beneficial for treating multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.

These studies underscore the significance of innovative QAC derivatives in addressing the growing challenge of antimicrobial resistance. The research highlights the potential of QACs and their variants in developing new antimicrobial agents with enhanced efficacy, reduced toxicity, and improved targeting capabilities. These advancements could lead to more effective infection control measures and therapeutic strategies against resistant bacterial strains like MRSA, significantly impacting public health and infection management.
