The selected scientific articles collectively explore the integration of agent-based frameworks and artificial intelligence (AI) in various domains, highlighting advancements and challenges in these fields.

The article "Leveraging Large Language Models and Agent-Based Systems for Scientific Data Analysis: Validation Study" presents the LITURAt system, which uses an agent-based architecture to enhance the application of large language models in scientific data analysis. This system addresses issues of factual accuracy and domain-specific precision by incorporating external data retrieval and analysis tools, ensuring that outputs are both reliable and context-aware. The methodology underscores the potential of agent-based systems in making scientific information more accessible, bridging the gap between experts and non-experts.

In "Measuring water pollution effects on antimicrobial resistance through explainable artificial intelligence," the authors utilize explainable AI to examine factors affecting antimicrobial resistance. This study employs the One Health framework to identify key indicators at the country level, revealing the significant impact of water quality and accessibility on mortality due to antimicrobial resistance. The findings suggest that AI can be a powerful tool for decision support in public health, offering insights into environmental and societal influences on health outcomes.

While the other articles do not directly focus on agent-based systems or AI frameworks, they contribute to the broader context of AI in healthcare and scientific research. For instance, the "Smart Pharmaceutical Monitoring System" article discusses the development of AI-driven systems for personalized medication management in diabetes care, emphasizing the role of digital technologies in improving treatment adherence and outcomes.

Overall, these studies demonstrate the transformative potential of integrating agent-based frameworks and AI in scientific and healthcare domains. They highlight the importance of accurate, context-aware systems in enhancing data analysis, decision-making, and accessibility, with implications for improving public health and scientific communication.
