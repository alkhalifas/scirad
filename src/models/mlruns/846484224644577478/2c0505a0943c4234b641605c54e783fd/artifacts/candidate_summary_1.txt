The scientific articles reviewed focus on the integration of agent-based frameworks and artificial intelligence (AI) systems, highlighting their application in various domains. The study "Leveraging Large Language Models and Agent-Based Systems for Scientific Data Analysis" explores the use of the LITURAt system, which employs an agent-based architecture to enhance the accuracy and domain-specific precision of large language models in scientific data analysis. This system addresses common limitations of language models by incorporating external data retrieval and analysis tools, ensuring reliable and context-aware outputs. The key finding is that agent-based systems can significantly improve the accessibility and reliability of scientific information for both experts and non-experts.

In "Measuring water pollution effects on antimicrobial resistance through explainable artificial intelligence," the authors utilize explainable AI within the One Health framework to identify factors influencing antimicrobial resistance. This research emphasizes the critical role of water quality indicators in predicting mortality linked to antimicrobial resistance across countries. The study demonstrates the utility of explainable AI as a decision-support tool for monitoring and addressing antimicrobial resistance.

The other articles, though not directly focused on agent-based frameworks, illustrate the broader application of AI in healthcare and scientific research. For instance, the "Smart Pharmaceutical Monitoring System" article discusses AI's potential in personalizing medication schedules for diabetes patients, addressing challenges like treatment complexity and patient adherence.

Overall, these studies underscore the transformative potential of integrating agent-based frameworks and AI systems in scientific and healthcare domains. They highlight methodologies that enhance precision, reliability, and decision-making capabilities, with significant implications for improving data analysis, healthcare management, and addressing global challenges like antimicrobial resistance. These advancements suggest a promising future for AI-driven solutions in complex, real-world applications.
