CRISPR technology continues to revolutionize the fields of genomics and biotechnology, as evidenced by recent scientific explorations. In the realm of porcine embryos, CRISPR/Cas9 has emerged as a transformative tool, enhancing genetic modifications for biomedical and agricultural research. However, challenges like off-target effects and mosaicism persist, necessitating refined methodologies for improved accuracy and reduced mosaicism (Navigating gene editing in porcine embryos).

In diagnostics, the integration of recombinase-polymerase amplification with CRISPR-Cas12a has simplified nucleic acid detection, although improvements in efficiency and complexity are needed (DNAzyme-Triggered Equilibrium Transfer). In agriculture, CRISPR-mediated prime editing has been successfully applied to rice, facilitating efficient gene tagging and genetic improvements, such as restoring brown pigment production in rice by correcting a 14-bp deletion (Efficient in situ epitope tagging of rice genes; Prime editing via precise sequence insertion).

The development of the EXPERT system has expanded prime editing's capacity for large fragment edits, significantly enhancing editing efficiency without increasing off-target effects (EXPERT expands prime editing efficiency). Additionally, novel cytidine deaminases have been harnessed for robust base editing in rice, demonstrating high efficiency and minimal off-target effects (Harnessing novel cytidine deaminases).

In synthetic biology, CRISPR/Cas systems have enabled the engineering of bacteriophages to target antibiotic-resistant superbugs, emphasizing the potential for phage therapy in combating antibiotic resistance (Engineering bacteriophages for targeted superbug eradication). Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9 editing of the BCL11B gene in lymphoid progenitors has shown promising results for developing NK-like cells with prolonged anti-leukemic activity (Targeting BCL11B in CAR-engineered lymphoid progenitors).

Lastly, CRISPR-Cas9 has facilitated the functional characterization of pathogenicity genes in Fusarium circinatum, advancing understanding of the molecular basis of pathogenicity and opening new avenues for pathogen research (CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing reveals that the Pgs gene of fusarium circinatum is involved in pathogenicity).

These studies underscore CRISPR's vast potential in biotechnology and genomics, promising advancements in agriculture, medicine, and pathogen research.
