The scientific articles reviewed here explore various applications of agent-based frameworks and artificial intelligence (AI) in different domains, highlighting their methodologies, key findings, and implications.

The first article, "Leveraging Large Language Models and Agent-Based Systems for Scientific Data Analysis," discusses the LITURAt system, which integrates large language models with an agent-based architecture to enhance scientific data analysis. This system addresses the challenges of factual accuracy and domain-specific precision by employing external data retrieval and analysis tools. The key finding is that LITURAt can produce reliable, context-aware outputs, making scientific information more accessible to both experts and nonexperts. This has significant implications for improving the accuracy and accessibility of scientific communication.

The second article, "Measuring water pollution effects on antimicrobial resistance through explainable artificial intelligence," employs an explainable AI framework to assess the impact of water pollution on antimicrobial resistance. By using a comprehensive set of indicators from the One Health framework, the study identifies water accessibility and quality as critical factors influencing mortality due to antimicrobial resistance. This research underscores the potential of AI as a decision-support tool in public health, particularly in monitoring and addressing antimicrobial resistance.

The remaining articles, while not directly focused on agent-based frameworks, highlight the broader application of AI in healthcare and scientific research. For instance, the "Smart Pharmaceutical Monitoring System" article discusses the development of an AI-driven system for personalized medication management in diabetes care, emphasizing the role of AI in enhancing treatment adherence and patient self-management.

Overall, these studies demonstrate the transformative potential of agent-based frameworks and AI in improving data analysis, healthcare outcomes, and scientific communication. They highlight the importance of integrating AI with domain-specific knowledge to address complex challenges across various fields.
